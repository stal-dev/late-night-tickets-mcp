## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Finding Daily Show Opportunities
**User Query:** "When is the next opportunity for me to attend the Daily show?"

**Response:**
```
Great news! I found several upcoming Daily Show tapings with available tickets. Here are your next opportunities to attend The Daily Show:

Upcoming Daily Show Tapings:
- Tuesday, July 15, 2025 at 4:30 PM ET in New York City
- Wednesday, July 16, 2025 at 4:30 PM ET in New York City
- Thursday, July 17, 2025 at 4:30 PM ET in New York City
- Tuesday, July 22, 2025 at 4:30 PM ET in New York City

The earliest opportunity is next Tuesday, July 15th - just two weeks away! All of these tapings are filmed at The Daily Show's studio in New York City, and tickets are currently showing as available.
```

### Example 2: Finding Guest Appearances
**User Query:** "When is the next time I can see Conan O'Brien?"

**Response:**
```
Based on the guest lineup, Conan O'Brien will be appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers on Monday, July 7th. The show typically airs at 12:35 AM ET on NBC (so technically early Tuesday morning, July 8th).
This appears to be a repeat episode from June 11, 2025, but it's your next opportunity to see Conan on late night TV!
```

### Example 3: This Week's Available Shows
**User Query:** "Which show can I see this week?"

**Response:**
```
Looking at this week's schedule (July 1-6, 2025), I don't see any Daily Show tapings available. The earliest Daily Show taping with available tickets is next Tuesday, July 15th.

However, if you're interested in attending other late-night shows this week, I can see there are some available:

This Week's Available Shows:
- Monday, July 7th: Jimmy Kimmel Live at 3:15 PM PT (Los Angeles)
- Tuesday, July 8th: Jimmy Kimmel Live at 3:15 PM PT (Los Angeles)
- Wednesday, July 9th: The View at 9:30 AM ET (NYC) and Jimmy Kimmel Live at 3:15 PM PT (LA)
- Thursday, July 10th: The View at 9:30 AM ET (NYC) and Jimmy Kimmel Live at 3:15 PM PT (LA)

Since you're in New York City, The View would be your most convenient option this week if you want to attend a show taping.
```

### Example 4: Location-Specific Search
**User Query:** "Which late night shows are available next Monday in Los Angeles?"

**Response:**
```
Looking at next Monday, July 14, 2025 in Los Angeles, here are the available late-night shows:

Monday, July 14th in Los Angeles:
- Jimmy Kimmel Live at 3:15 PM PT

That's the only late-night show option available in Los Angeles for next Monday.

If you're willing to consider New York City shows for that same day, there are also:
- Late Night with Seth Meyers at 2:00 PM ET
- The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon at 3:45 PM ET

But if you specifically want to stay in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel Live would be your only option for next Monday.
```

### Example 5: Calendar Integration
**User Query:** "Add The Daily Show on July 15th at 4:30 PM ET to my calendar"

**Response:**
```
Successfully created calendar event for The Daily Show on July 15, 2025 at 4:30 PM ET.
