## Ticket Availability Samples

### Sample 1: Specific Show Availability

**Prompt:** When is the next opportunity for me to attend The Daily Show?

**Response:** I'll help you find information about The Daily Show ticket availability. Let me check what shows are available and when you might be able to attend.

Great news! I found several upcoming Daily Show tapings with available tickets. Here are your next opportunities to attend **The Daily Show**:

* **Tuesday, July 15, 2025** at 4:30 PM ET in New York City
* **Wednesday, July 16, 2025** at 4:30 PM ET in New York City
* **Thursday, July 17, 2025** at 4:30 PM ET in New York City
* **Tuesday, July 22, 2025** at 4:30 PM ET in New York City

The earliest opportunity is next **Tuesday, July 15th** â€” just two weeks away! All of these tapings are filmed at The Daily Show's studio in New York City, and tickets are currently showing as **available**.
Since you're located in New York City, attending any of these tapings would be convenient for you. I'd recommend securing tickets soon, as late-night show tickets can fill up quickly, especially for popular shows like The Daily Show.
Would you like me to check if there are any special guests scheduled for these upcoming tapings?

### Sample 2: Shows Available This Week

**Prompt:** What late night shows have available tickets this week?

**Response:** Looking at this week's schedule (July 1-6, 2025), I don't see any Daily Show tapings available. The earliest Daily Show taping with available tickets is next Tuesday, July 15th.
However, if you're interested in attending other late-night shows this week, I can see there are some available:

**This Week's Available Shows:**

* **Monday, July 7th:** Jimmy Kimmel Live at 3:15 PM PT (Los Angeles)
* **Tuesday, July 8th:** Jimmy Kimmel Live at 3:15 PM PT (Los Angeles)
* **Wednesday, July 9th:** The View at 9:30 AM ET (NYC) and Jimmy Kimmel Live at 3:15 PM PT (LA)
* **Thursday, July 10th:** The View at 9:30 AM ET (NYC) and Jimmy Kimmel Live at 3:15 PM PT (LA)

Since you're in New York City, **The View** would be your most convenient option this week if you want to attend a show taping. Otherwise, you'll need to wait until July 15th for the next Daily Show opportunity.

### Sample 3: Shows in a Specific Location and Day

**Prompt:** Which late night shows are available next Monday in Los Angeles?

**Response:** Looking at next **Monday, July 14, 2025**, in Los Angeles, here are the available late-night shows:

**Monday, July 14th in Los Angeles:**

* **Jimmy Kimmel Live** at 3:15 PM PT

That's the only late-night show option available in Los Angeles for next Monday.
If you're willing to consider New York City shows for that same day, there are also:

* Late Night with Seth Meyers at 2:00 PM ET
* The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon at 3:45 PM ET

But if you specifically want to stay in Los Angeles, **Jimmy Kimmel Live** would be your only option for next Monday.

## Guest Lineup Samples

### Sample 1: Finding a Specific Guest

**Prompt:** When is the next time I can see Conan O'Brien on a late night show?

**Response:** Based on the guest lineup, **Conan O'Brien** will be appearing on **Late Night with Seth Meyers** on **Monday, July 7th**. The show typically airs at 12:35 AM ET on NBC (so technically early Tuesday morning, July 8th).
This appears to be a repeat episode from June 11, 2025, but it's your next opportunity to see Conan on late night TV!
